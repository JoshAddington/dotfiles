  #       (a) compared to sending a keystroke, this is more robust and predictable; with sending a keystroke, the shell command to execute is *sometimes* sent to the *previous* tab, as the keystroke may not have been processed yet.
  #           In the default case, the GUI scripting finds the command by its keyboard shortcut so as to work locale-independently; it does, however, make the following assumptions (other than the pretty safe assumption that the command is in the 3rd menu from the left, the "Shell" menu in English):
  #       (b) it also allows us to create new tabs *with specific settings*, by finding the menu item by *name* (settings names are locale-*in*dependent, fortunately)

# MAN PAGE MARKDOWN SOURCE
#  - Place a Markdown-formatted version of the man page for this script
#    inside the here-document below.
#    The document must be formatted to look good in all 3 viewing scenarios:
#     - as a man page, after conversion to ROFF with marked-man
#     - as plain text (raw Markdown source)
#     - as HTML (rendered Markdown)
#  Markdown formatting tips:
#   - GENERAL
#     To support plain-text rendering in the terminal, limit all lines to 80 chars.,
#     and, for similar rendering as HTML, *end every line with 2 trailing spaces*.
#   - HEADINGS
#     - For better plain-text rendering, leave an empty line after a heading
#       marked-man will remove it from the ROFF version.
#     - The first heading must be a level-1 heading containing the utility
#       name and very brief description; append the manual-section number 
#       directly to the CLI name; e.g.:
#         # foo(1) - does bar
#     - The 2nd, level-2 heading must be '## SYNOPSIS' and the chapter's body
#       must render reasonably as plain text, because it is printed to stdout
#       when  `-h`, `--help` is specified:
#         Use 4-space indentation without markup for both the syntax line and the
#         block of brief option descriptions; represent option-arguments and operands
#         in angle brackets; e.g., '<foo>'
#     - All other headings should be level-2 headings in ALL-CAPS.
#   - TEXT
#      - Use NO indentation for regular chapter text; if you do, it will 
#        be indented further than list items.
#      - Use 4-space indentation, as usual, for code blocks.
#      - Markup character-styling markup translates to ROFF rendering as follows:
#         `...` and **...** render as bolded (red) text
#         _..._ and *...* render as word-individually underlined text
#   - LISTS
#      - Indent list items by 2 spaces for better plain-text viewing, but note
#        that the ROFF generated by marked-man still renders them unindented.
#      - End every list item (bullet point) itself with 2 trailing spaces too so
#        that it renders on its own line.
#      - Avoid associating more than 1 paragraph with a list item, if possible,
#        because it requires the following trick, which hampers plain-text readability:
#        Use '&nbsp;<space><space>' in lieu of an empty line.

# ttab(1) - open a new Terminal.app / iTerm.app tab or window

## SYNOPSIS

Opens a new terminal tab or window in OS X's Terminal application or iTerm.

    ttab [-w] [-s <settings>] [-t <title>] [-g|-G] [-d <dir>] [<cmd> [<arg>...]]

    -w                  open new tab in new terminal window
    -s <settings>       assign a settings set (profile)
    -t <title>          specify title for new tab (not supported in iTerm)
    -g                  create tab in background (don't activate Terminal/iTerm)
    -G                  create tab in background and don't activate new tab
    -d <dir>            specify working directory
    <cmd> [<arg>...]    command to execute in the new tab

Standard options: `--help`, `--man`, `--version`, `--home`

## DESCRIPTION

`ttab` opens a new Terminal.app or iTerm.app tab with a variety of options,  
including executing a command in the new tab, assigning a title and working  
directory, and opening the tab in a new window.

Note: iTerm.app support is experimental in that it is currently not covered by  
the automated tests run before every release.

IMPORTANT: **Terminal.app/iTerm.app must be allowed assistive access** in order  
for this  utility to work, which requires one-time authorization with  
administrative privileges. If you get error messages instead of being prompted,  
authorize the application via  
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.

The new tab will run a login shell (i.e., load the user's shell profile)  
and by default inherit the working directory from the parent shell.

When specifying a command to execute in the new tab, quoted parameters are  
handled properly and there's no need to quote the command as a whole,  
provided it is a *single* command.  
Prefix such a single command with `exec` to exit the shell after the command  
terminates. If the tab's settings are configured to close tabs on termination  
of the shell, the tab will close automatically.

To specify *multiple* commands, use `eval` followed by a single, quoted  
string containing the entire shell command line to execute; in the simplest  
case, enclose the string in single-quotes and use ';' to separate commands.  
Use `exit` as the last command to automatically close the tab when the  
command terminates, assuming the tab's settings are configured to close the  
tab on termination of the shell.  
Precede `exit` with `read -rsn 1` to wait for a keystroke first.

## OPTIONS

 * `-w`  
    creates the new tab in a new window rather than in the front  
    window.

 * `-s <settings>`  
    specifies the settings set (profile) to apply to the new tab, determining  
    the appearance and behavior of the new tab.  
    o Terminal.app: settings sets are defined in Preferences > Profiles;  
    name matching is case-*in*sensitive, and specifying nonexistent settings  
    causes an error.
    o Term.app: profiles are defined in Preferences > Profiles; name matching is  
    case-*sensitive*, and specifying a nonexistent profile is ignored.

 * `-t <title>` (not supported in iTerm)   
    specifies a custom title to assign to the new tab; otherwise, if a   
    command is specified, its first token will become the new tab's title.

 * `-d <dir>`  
    explicitly specifies a working directory for the new tab; by default, the  
    invoking shell's working directory is inherited (even if `-w` is also  
    specified).

 * `-g`  
    (back*g*round) causes Terminal/iTerm not to activate, if it isn't the  
    frontmost application); within the application, however, the new tab will  
    become the active tab; useful in scripts that launch other applications and  
    don't want Terminal/iTerm to steal focus later.

 * `-G`  
    causes Terminal/iTerm not to activate *and* the active element within  
    the application not to change; i.e., the active window and tab stay the  
    same. If Terminal/iTerm happens to be frontmost, the new tab will  
    effectively open in the background.

NOTE: With `-g` or `-G` specified, for technical reasons, Terminal/iTerm /  
      the new tab will still activate *briefly, temporarily* in most scenarios.

## STANDARD OPTIONS

All standard options provide information only.

 * `-h, --help`  
    Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick reference.

 * `--man`  
    Displays this manual page, which is a helpful alternative to using `man`, 
    if the manual page isn't installed.

 * `--version`  
    Prints version information.
    
 * `--home`  
    Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser.
